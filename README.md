# AWS IoT and FreeRTOS for PSoC 6 MCU: WLAN Low Power

This code example demonstrates the low-power operation of the PSoC 6 MCU (host) and the WLAN device using the [Low Power Assistant (LPA) middleware](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/lpa).

The code example connects to a configured Wi-Fi network. After connecting to the network successfully, the example configures the WLAN device in a power save mode, suspends the network stack, and puts the host MCU in a wait state. During this wait state, the host MCU enters a low-power state and wakes up on any network activity detected between the host MCU and the WLAN device.

## Hardware Setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note:** The PSoC 6 BLE Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software Setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

This example requires no additional software or tools.

## Using the Code Example

### First Steps:

The steps in this section are a one time activity by the user. The following commands clone the Amazon FreeRTOS repository, check out the specified branch, and then finally clone this code example.

1. Clone the ModusToolbox Amazon FreeRTOS SDK from [GitHub](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/amazon-freertos). The following command clones all the submodules.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/amazon-freertos.git -b 202007-MTBAFR2041 --recurse-submodules
   ```

2. Go to *<amazon-freertos>/projects/cypress* folder. Clone or download this code example, or copy it if you already have it.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/afr-example-wlan-lowpower.git
   ```

   Alternatively, clone the example outside of *amazon-freertos* directory but make sure that `AFR_PATH` and `CY_AFR_ROOT` are set correctly in *CMakeLists.txt* and *Makefile* respectively. If you use Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox, you must clone the code example under *<amazon-freertos>/projects/cypress* because the Eclipse project files use relative paths to link to the files under <amazon-freertos>.

3. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

4. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.


### In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox:

1. Go to **File** > **Import**.

2. Choose **Existing Projects into Workspace** under **General** and click **Next**. 

3. Click the **Browse** button near **Select root directory**, choose the CE folder *\<amazon-freertos>/projects/cypress/afr-example-wlan-lowpower*, and click **Finish**. 

4. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

5. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **afr-example-wlan-lowpower Program (KitProg3)**.

To program a target board different from the default one defined using the `TARGET` variable in the Makefile, you need to generate the launch configurations for the new target. See [Running FreeRTOS Code Examples - KBA228845](https://www.cypress.com/KBA228845) for details.

### Using Make Command Line Interface (CLI):

1. Download and unzip this repository onto your local machine, or clone the repository.

2. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the application folder. 

   On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. On Windows, navigate to the modus-shell directory (*{ModusToolbox install directory}/tools_\<version>/modus-shell*) and run *Cygwin.bat*.

3. From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:

   ```
   make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
   ```
   Example:

   ```
   make program TARGET=CY8CPROTO-062-4343W TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
   ```

### Using CMake CLI:

1. Go to *\<amazon-freertos>/projects/cypress/afr-example-wlan-lowpower* folder.

2. Run the following command. This command will generate a build configuration under a new folder called *build* in the current directory.

   ```
   cmake -DVENDOR=cypress -DCOMPILER=arm-gcc -DBOARD=CY8CPROTO_062_4343W -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../../../tools/cmake/toolchains/arm-gcc.cmake
   ```

3. Once CMake has generated the configuration, run the following command to build the project:

   ```
   cmake --build build
   ```
   To clean and then build, use the following command:

   ```
   cmake --build build --clean-first
   ```

4. Program the *\<Application Name>.elf* file generated under the *build* folder using Cypress Programmer.

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Modify the `WIFI_SSID`, `WIFI_PASSWORD`, and `WIFI_SECURITY` macros to match credentials to that of the Wi-Fi network you want to connect to. These macros are defined in the *lowpower_task.h* file.

   **Note:** See the AP's configuration page for the security type. See the `WIFISecurity_t` enumeration in *iot_wifi.h* to pass the corresponding security type in the `WIFI_SECURITY` macro.

4. Ensure that your computer is connected to the same Wi-Fi AP that you have configured in Step 3.

5. Build the code example and program the board by following the steps given for your choice of build system (Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox, Make, or CMake) in the previous sections. After programming, the following logs will appear on the serial terminal:

    ```

    ```

6. Open a command prompt and ping the IP address displayed on the serial terminal:

    ```
    ping <IP address>
    ```

   The network stack is resumed. The device displays the deep sleep and Wi-Fi SDIO bus statistics on the terminal as follows:

    ```

    =====================================================
    Network is active. Resuming network stack
    ```

   **Note:** The host MCU will wake up on any network activity and not necessarily due to pings from the PC. The reasons for network activity could be broadcast or multicast packets issued by the AP. 
   
   Further power savings can be made by employing offload features such as packet filtering, which will increase the time the host MCU will be in deep sleep. See [AN227910 - Low-Power System Design with CYW43012 and PSoC 6 MCU](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/application-notes/an227910-low-power-system-design-cyw43012-and-psoc-6-mcu) for more details.

See [Measuring Current Consumption](#measuring-current-consumption) for instructions on how to measure the current consumed by the PSoC 6 MCU and Wi-Fi devices.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and Debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice - before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

## Design and Implementation

This application uses the lwIP network stack, which runs multiple network timers for various network-related activities. These timers need to be serviced by the host MCU. As a result, the host MCU will not be able to stay in sleep or deep sleep state longer. 

In this example, after successfully connecting to an AP, the host MCU suspends the network stack after a period of inactivity. The example uses two macros, `NETWORK_INACTIVE_INTERVAL_MS` and `NETWORK_INACTIVE_WINDOW_MS`, to determine whether the network is inactive. The network is monitored for inactivity in an interval of length `NETWORK_INACTIVE_INTERVAL_MS`. If the network is inactive for a continuous duration specified by `NETWORK_INACTIVE_WINDOW_MS`, the network stack will be suspended until there is network activity.

The host MCU is alerted by the WLAN device on network activity after which the network stack is resumed. The host MCU is in deep sleep during the time the network stack is suspended. Because there are no network timers to be serviced, the host MCU will stay in deep sleep for longer. This state where the host MCU is in deep sleep waiting for network activity is referred to as "wait state".

On the other hand, the WLAN device is configured in one of the supported power save modes:

1. **Power-save with Poll:** This mode corresponds to (legacy) 802.11 PS-Poll mode and should be used to achieve the lowest power consumption possible when the Wi-Fi device is primarily passively listening to the network.

2. **Power-save Without Poll:** This mode attempts to increase the throughput by waiting for a timeout period before returning to sleep rather than returning to sleep immediately.

The power-save mode can be set through the `WLAN_POWERSAVE_MODE` macro. The WLAN device wakes at every DTIM interval to receive beacon frames from the AP.

For more information on low-power system design that involves offloading tasks to the WLAN device for even better power savings, see [AN227910 - Low-Power System Design with CYW43012 and PSoC 6 MCU](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/application-notes/an227910-low-power-system-design-cyw43012-and-psoc-6-mcu).

### Creating a Custom Device Configuration for Low Power

This code example overrides the default device configuration provided in *<amazon-freertos>/vendors/cypress/boards/\<kit>/aws_demos/application_code/cy_code/GeneratedSource/* with the one provided in *<application_folder>/COMPONENT_CUSTOM_DESIGN_MODUS/TARGET_\<kit>* for the supported kits.  

The custom configuration disables the Phase-Locked Loop (PLL), disables the HF clock for unused peripherals like audio/USB, and configures the Buck regulator instead of the Low Dropout (LDO) regulator to power the PSoC 6 MCU device. This configuration reduces the current consumed by the PSoC 6 MCU device in active state.  

If your application uses any of the disabled peripherals, the corresponding peripherals and clocks should be enabled using the Device Configurator. Launch this tool from the **Quick Panel** inside the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox, or from the command line using the following command:

```
make config TARGET=CY8CKIT-062S2-43012
```

Do the following to create a custom configuration for a new kit. The steps are provided for **CY8CKIT-062S2-43012** kit; however, other supported kits can be configured in a similar way.

1. Create a new directory inside *COMPONENT_CUSTOM_DESIGN_MODUS* with the same name as the target you are building the example for, such as *<application_folder>/COMPONENT_CUSTOM_DESIGN_MODUS/TARGET_\<kit>*.

2. Copy the *design.modus* file from the *<amazon-freertos>/vendors/cypress/boards/\<kit>/aws_demos/application_code/cy_code/* folder into the folder created in the previous step.

   **Note:** The *design.cycapsense* and *design.qspi* files can also be copied so that you don't have to configure these peripherals again. All you have to do is to enable these peripherals in *design.modus* to use them.  

3. Open the copied *design.modus* file using Device Configurator.

4. Do the following on the PSoC 6 MCU **Pins** tab of the Device Configurator tool:

   1. Enable the Host Wake pin **P4[1]** and name it *CYBSP_WIFI_HOST_WAKE*.

   2. In the **Parameters** pane, change the following:

       - **Drive Mode:** Analog High-Z. Input buffer off

       - **Initial Drive State:** High(1)

       - **Interrupt Trigger Type:** Rising Edge

       **Figure 1. Configuring Host Wake Pin for CY8CKIT-062S2-43012**
       ![](images/figure1.png)

   **Note:** The Wi-Fi host driver takes care of the drive mode configuration of the Host Wake pin.

   The Host Wake pin (*CYBSP_WIFI_HOST_WAKE*) is different for each supported kit. See the board file *cybsp_types.h* present under *<amazon-freertos>/vendors/cypress/boards/\<kit>/aws_demos/application_code/cy_code/* and search for the `CYBSP_WIFI_HOST_WAKE` macro in the file for the Host Wake pin.

5. Go to the **Wi-Fi** tab and enable the host wake configuration and set **Host Device Interrupt Pin** to `CYBSP_WIFI_HOST_WAKE`. This configuration is applicable to all supported kits.

    **Figure 2. Enable Host Wake Pin**
    ![](images/figure2.png)

6. Switch to the **System** tab, expand the **System Clocks** resource, and do the following:
   
   1. Clear the box in the **FLL+PLL** section to disable the PLL.

   2. In the **High Frequency** section, disable HF clocks for the peripherals that are not being used in this code example.

       **Figure 3. Clock Settings in CY8CKIT-062S2-43012**
       ![](images/figure3.png)

   3. In the **System Clocks** resource, select **CLK_HF0** and modify the **Source Clock** to **CLK_PATH0**.

      **Figure 4. CLK_HF0 Settings for CY8CKIT-062S2-43012**
      ![](images/figure4.png)

7. Under the **Power** resource, change the **Core Regulator** under **General** to **Buck**.

   **Figure 5. Configuring Core Regulator as Buck**
   ![](images/figure5.png)

8. Optionally, you can make higher power savings by switching to ULP (Ultra Low Power) mode. However, this mode requires the CM4 CPU to be limited to a maximum operating frequency of 50 MHz. Switching to ULP mode causes a few warnings to appear for **FLL** and **CLK_PERI** because their frequencies are greater than 50 MHz and 25 MHz respectively. Therefore, configure the **FLL Desired Frequency** to 50 MHz, and set the **CLK_PERI** divider to **2**.

    1. Under the **Power** resource, change the **System Active Power Mode** under **General** to **ULP**. 

       **Figure 6. Configuring System Active Power Mode**
       ![](images/figure6.png)

    2. Under the **System** tab, expand the **System Clocks** resource, select **FLL**, and modify the **Desired Frequency** to **50.000 MHz**.

       **Figure 7. FLL Settings**
       ![](images/figure7.png)

   **Note:**

   For the *CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT* kit, the PSoC 6 MCU device consists of a UDB-based SDHC block for SDIO communication with the WLAN device. This requires the **System Active Power Mode** to be configured with **LP** mode to run the peripheral clocks at 100 MHz.

9. Save the file to generate the source files.

10. Disable the default configuration and enable the custom configuration by making the following changes:

    **Using Make build system:** 
    
    Add the following in *Makefile*.

    ```
    COMPONENTS += CUSTOM_DESIGN_MODUS
    ```

    **Using CMake build system:** 
    
    Do the following in *CMakeLists.txt* to pick the custom design configuration. The following the snippets are captured from the *CMakeLists.txt* file; these highlight the changes needed for selecting the custom design configuration. See the *CMakeLists.txt* file directly to learn about the complete configuration flow.

    - Set an option *CUSTOM_DESIGN_MODUS*.

      ```
      option(CUSTOM_DESIGN_MODUS "Use custom design configuration.")
      ```

    - Add the *GeneratedSource* folder present under *COMPONENT_CUSTOM_DESIGN_MODUS/TARGET_<kit>/* to the part of the build.

      ```
      set(CY_APP_DESIGN_MODUS_DIR      "${CY_APP_DIR}/COMPONENT_CUSTOM_DESIGN_MODUS/TARGET_${APP_BOARD_NAME}/GeneratedSource" )

      if (DEFINED CUSTOM_DESIGN_MODUS)
          list(APPEND additional_include_dirs     "${CY_APP_DESIGN_MODUS_DIR}")
      else()
          list(APPEND additional_include_dirs     "${BOARD_CY_CODE_DIR}/GeneratedSource")
      endif()

      set(CY_INCLUDE_DIRS ${additional_include_dirs} CACHE INTERNAL "")

      # Application sources
      file(GLOB_RECURSE CY_APP_EXTRA_SOURCES
          ...
          ...
      if (DEFINED CUSTOM_DESIGN_MODUS)
          "${CY_APP_DESIGN_MODUS_DIR}/*.c"
          "${CY_APP_DESIGN_MODUS_DIR}/*.h"
      endif()
          ...
          ...
      )
      ```

    - Exclude the default BSP design sources:

      ```
      if (DEFINED CUSTOM_DESIGN_MODUS)
          foreach(item ${exe_glob_files})
              if(${item} MATCHES "GeneratedSource")
                  list(REMOVE_ITEM exe_glob_files ${item})
              endif(${item} MATCHES "GeneratedSource")
          endforeach()
      endif()
      ```

## Measuring Current Consumption

### CY8CKIT-062S2-43012

**For PSoC 6 MCU:** 
   1. Remove J25 to eliminate leakage currents across the potentiometer R1.
   
   2. Measure the current at J15 across VTARG and P6_VDD.  

**For CYW43012:** 
   1. Measure the current at VDDIO_WL used for the SDIO communication interface, and at VBAT used for powering CYW43xxx. 

   2. Measure at VDDIO_WL across VDDIO_WL and VCC_VDDIO2 at J17.

   3. Measure at VBAT across VBAT and VCC_VBAT at J8. 


### CY8CPROTO-062-4343W

**For PSoC 6 MCU:** 
   1. Remove R65 on the right of the board close to the USB connector of the PSoC 6 MCU device.

   2. Connect an ammeter between VTARG (J2.32) and P6_VDD (J2.24). 

   3. Remove R24 at the back of the board, below J1.9, to eliminate the leakage current. 

      R24 is the pull-up resistor attached to the WL_HOST_WAKE pin P0_4, which leaks approximately 330 uA because P0_4 is driven LOW when there is no network activity. In total, the PSoC 6 MCU deep sleep current is approximately 350 uA. 

**For CYW4343W:** 

Measure the current at the VDDIO_1LV supply used for the SDIO communication interface, and at VBAT1 and VBAT2 supplies used for powering CYW4343W. VBAT1 and VABT2 are shorted to each other. 

1. Remove R87 on the back of the board towards the right and above J2.33. 
   
2. Connect an ammeter between the pads of R87 to measure the current.

3. Measure the current at VDDIO_1LV:

   1. Remove the resistor R86 on the back of the board, below J1.27. 
   
   2. Connect an ammeter between the pads of R86 to measure the current. 

Note that the current at VDDIO_1LV will depend on the SDIO transactions that happen because of the pull-up resistors on the lines to VDDIO_1LV. Also, VDDIO_1LV (named VDDIO_1DX in the carrier module (CY8CMOD_062_4343W) schematic) allows a current of 38 uA through R24 because WL_HOST_WAKE is LOW. This current needs to be deducted from the observed value of VDDIO_1LV.

### CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT

**For PSoC 6 MCU:**

Connect an ammeter to the PWR MON jumper J8.

**For CYW4343W:**

Measure the current at supplies WL_VBAT used for powering CYW4343W, and WL_VDDIO used for the SDIO communication interface.

1. Measure the current at WL_VBAT:
   1. Remove L3 at the right edge of the board close to the CYW4343W module.

   2. Connect an ammeter between the pads of L3.

2. Measure the current at WL_VDDIO:
   1. Remove L7 at the top left corner on the back of the board.
   
   2. Connect an ammeter between the pads of L7.

## Typical Current Measurement Values

Table 1 provides the typical current measurement values for the CY8CKIT-062S2-43012 kit. All measurements were made in the presence of external radio interference and not in an isolated environment with a single AP. Note that the typical values of current consumed by the supply powering the SDIO interface between the host MCU and WLAN device are not provided because the value of current varies with the transaction over the interface.

Here, PSoC 6 MCU is operated with ArmÂ® CortexÂ®-M4 running at 50 MHz in Ultra Low Power (ULP) mode with full RAM retention.
